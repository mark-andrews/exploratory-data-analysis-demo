# Raw data

Data sets taken from [openpsychometrics.org](http://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/).

For each data set, which is a csv file, there is a codebook explaining the variables.

## Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI)

40 two-alternative forced choice questions measuring narcissism, based on scale developed by Raskim & Terry (1988).

Raskin, R.; Terry, H. (1988). "A principal-components analysis of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory and further evidence of its construct validity". Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 54(5), 890-902.

## Big Five Personality test (Big5)

50 item big five personality scale; 10 items per each personality trait. More information on the scale and how to score it can be found at [IPIP](https://ipip.ori.org). For example, the 10 extraversion items and their scoring is available on the IPIP site [here](https://ipip.ori.org/newBigFive5broadKey.htm#Extraversion).

I think the "O" items are not "openness". I can not find those items, at least not all of them, on [IPIP](https://ipip.ori.org). Those I can find appear to be classified as "intellect" rather than Big 5 "openness".
