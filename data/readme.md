The Rds files here were generated by the [data_preparation.R]("../data_preparation.R") R script, which uses raw data, found in the `raw-data` directory, [openpsychometrics.org](http://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/).

The file `npi.csv` is an identical dataset to `npi.Rds`, just in a different file format.
